Definition of Defender Game 

Defender is an arcade video game that is played horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up sytle. The game is set on an unnamed planet where the player must defeat waves of invaders (enemies) while avoiding projectiles from the enemy ships.

Implementation Part

First of all, the rules of the game should be known exactly. To navigate what we will do in detail, we need to create an UML diagram. According to diagram which shows classes, methods and their properties, it is easy to share the project in our group. Everyone in our group has a part of source code of the game. Each piece of code should be combinable so that we can make it as one executable program. Moreover, we need assets for illustration part of the game. Assets can be created by Photoshop CC. After created, we can use in the project and test it visually. 

As Defender is a 2D side-scrolling shooting game, the player controls a space ship as it navigates the atmosphere, flying to the left, right, up or down. With W-A-S-D buttons, player controls the ship's direction and also "space" button is used for firing a range of weapons including bullets, missiles and lasers. Defeating the aliens in particular wave level allows the player to progress to the next level. Also rescuing captured humans from aliens gives huge points. Failing to defeat enemy ships within a given amount of time or loosing health leads to game being over. The player's ship cannot withstand more than three hits. A ship icon which shows health of the player is lost if it is hit by an enemy or its projectiles, or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong (as they randomly do). After exhausting all ship icons, the game ends.
